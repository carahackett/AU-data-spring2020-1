From the final project page:

> For the interview component, Iâ€™m looking for something like what CNN or NPR regularly does when they bring the author of an interesting story in to give some details. The interviewer must be prepared with 3 or 4 questions, and the interviewee needs to be prepared to go into detail about the story and the reporting behind it. The interviewee should, as much as possible, use non-technical language as if they were communicating to a mass audience about how they broke the story.

* Take the [assessment quiz](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdedIUAUMuAeiMLaqgDMY5AEdxZnw70r2VzO-n3goUja-pWdQ/viewform) one more time 
* Discuss [extra credit assignment](extra-cred-assignment.md) and final class
